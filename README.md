# 🎓 Super GPA Calculator System

A modular Python-based GPA management system designed to simulate a real university-style academic record system. It supports semester, yearly, and cumulative GPA calculations with weighted grading, persistent student storage, and automatic report generation with historical archiving.

## 🚀 Features

- **Student Management**: Add students with multiple academic terms and courses.
- **GPA Calculations**:
  - Semester GPA (specific term)
  - Year GPA (all terms in a year)
  - Cumulative GPA (all terms across student's history)
- **Weighted Grading**: Supports regular (1.0x), honors (1.1x), and AP (1.2x) courses, capped at 4.0.
- **Persistent Storage**: JSON database with corruption safety, atomic writes, and automatic backups.
- **Report Generation**: Formatted text reports saved to `new_reports/`, auto-archived to `past_reports/` with timestamps.
- **CSV Export**: Export course data to a formatted text table after GPA calculation, including GPA summaries (unweighted, weighted, cumulative).
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling for grades (A-F), credits (>0), course types, and unique student IDs.
- **Error Logging**: Exceptions saved to `errors/YYYY-MM-DD/` subfolders with timestamps for debugging.
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple menu-driven system with built-in help.
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns across files for maintainability.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher (no external libraries required).

### Installation
1. Download or clone the project files into a directory.
2. Ensure Python is installed: `python3 --version`.
3. Run the application: `python3 main.py`.

Directories (`data/`, `new_reports/`, `past_reports/`) are created automatically on first run.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Starting the Application
Run `python3 main.py` to launch the CLI menu.

### Main Menu Options
1. **Add Student**: Create a new student record.
   - Enter name and unique ID.
   - Add academic terms (e.g., "Fall 2026").
   - For each term, add courses: name, grade (A-F), credits (>0), type (regular/honors/ap).
   - Type "done" to finish courses/terms.
2. **View Students**: List all stored students by ID and name.
3. **Calculate GPA**: Select a student and compute GPA.
   - Choose: Semester (specific term), Year (all terms in a year), or Cumulative (all terms).
   - Reports are generated, saved, and archived.
   - Option to export course data to CSV.
4. **Help**: Display in-app usage instructions and GPA rules.
5. **Exit**: Quit the application.

### GPA Calculation Example
- **Course 1**: Math, A, 3 credits, regular → 4.0 × 1.0 × 3 = 12 points
- **Course 2**: Science, B, 4 credits, honors → min(3.0 × 1.1, 4.0) × 4 = 4.0 × 4 = 16 points
- **Total**: 28 points / 7 credits = **4.0 GPA**

### Data Storage
- Student data persists in `data/students.json`.
- Reports in `new_reports/` are archived to `past_reports/` on new calculations.
- Automatic backups created if JSON corruption is detected.

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **GPA Scale**: A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0
- **Weighting Formula**: `min(grade_points × weight, 4.0) × credits`
- **Storage Safety**: Atomic JSON writes prevent corruption; backups on read errors.
- **Report Filtering**: Shows only relevant courses based on GPA type.
- **Report Export**: Formatted text table with aligned columns, headers, borders, and GPA summaries (unweighted, weighted, cumulative).

## 📝 Changelog

- **v1.0**: Initial release with semester/year GPA, basic storage.
- **v1.1**: Added cumulative GPA, CSV export, input validation, help menu, improved README.

## 🤝 Contributing

Enhance the system with:
- GUI (Tkinter/Flask)
- PDF report generation (reportlab)
- Database migration (SQLite)
- Unit tests (unittest/pytest)
- Advanced features (GPA trends, course prerequisites)

# ▶️ How to Run

## 1. Install Python
Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.

## 2. Run the program

```bash
python main.py
🧭 Main Menu

When launched:

===== SUPER GPA SYSTEM =====
1. Add Student
2. View Students
3. Calculate GPA
4. Exit
📊 GPA Calculation Options

After selecting a student:

1. Semester GPA
2. Year GPA
📌 Semester GPA

Calculates GPA for a single academic term.

Example:

Fall 2026
📌 Year GPA

Calculates GPA across all terms in a given year.

Example:

Fall 2026 + Spring 2026 → 2026 Year GPA
🧮 GPA Scale

B	3.0
C	2.0
D	1.0
F	0.0
Weighted System
Course Type	Multiplier
Regular	1.0
Honors	1.1
